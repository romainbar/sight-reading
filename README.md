# sight-reading
Browser based sight-reading applications.

Those are *zero footprint* applications using:
* the [Web MIDI API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi/), currently available in [Google Chrome browsers](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) to access MIDI controllers,
* the [VexTab](http://www.vexflow.com/vextab/) and [VexFlow](http://www.vexflow.com/) libraries to display sheet music.
